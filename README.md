What is it?
============================
Wavy is a C++ program that implements a marching squares algorithm for generating waves and makes use of the the [BGFX](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx) graphics library.

Ths was a project to learn how graphics are made. To gain an appreciation for rendering, graphics libraries, and engines.
